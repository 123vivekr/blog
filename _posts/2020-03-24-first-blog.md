It's been a while seen when I wanted to setup my blogging site but it always got delayed due to some work everytime. But as Coronavirus got everyone stay at their home, and I had some time on my hands, I just went with it. I am an introvert and therefore, not very social so I think maybe this is a good start to change my habit.

About blogging, I am not very specific what I am going to write but I think as I am an engineer, it's most probably going to be about coding something.

Thanks!
