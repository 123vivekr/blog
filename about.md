Hey wanderer! Thanks for stopping by!

I am Ayush Mittal, and this is my blog website. I am going to be software engineer, currently in the end semester of my B.Tech Degree program at [MSIT](http://www.msit.in). I like to eat, code, play video games and sleep! 

I love to try new things out, even though it's something related to coding or maybe some adventure, even though I suck at it. 

Codewise, I currently contribute to Open Source at Pitivi, a GNOME video editor tool.

Gameswise, I have played few games, not a pro gamer but it would be so cool!!

You can connect with me at the below mentioned social accounts like twitter, github, etc. Cheers!!!
